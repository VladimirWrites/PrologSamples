# PrologSamples

This repository contains solutions of some simple problems written in Prolog.

Problems
-------
1. Calculate X to the power of N, for N>0. ([`pow.pl`](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/PrologSamples/blob/master/pow.pl))
2. Calculate N factorial, for N>0. ([`factorial.pl`](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/PrologSamples/blob/master/factorial.pl))
3. Calculate N-th Fibonacci number, for N>=0. ([`fibonacci.pl`](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/PrologSamples/blob/master/fibonacci.pl))
4. Check if structure is a binary tree. ([`is_binary_tree.pl`](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/PrologSamples/blob/master/binary_tree/is_binary_tree.pl))
5. Sum all node values of a binary tree. ([`sum_binary_tree.pl`](https://github.com/VladimirWrites/PrologSamples/blob/master/binary_tree/sum_binary_tree.pl))
